Bee-Creative. An art assistant app to help artists with their creativity.

Through the use of the Apache Cordova package, this app was created as part of a student project. 
Artists can struggle getting creative on a regular basis. This can be due to lack of motivation, time, and mental health reasons. 
This app will help prompt artists to get more creative by using activities for them to do. These activities will give them a scenario and the app will ask them to draw something based on that scenario. 
For example, if the artist wanted to draw comic/cartoon characters, the app will give them a setting of a pub and ask the user to draw the first character they think of. 

Make sure nodejs and cordova are installede. To run program, create a new Cordova project, copy and paste the plugin and www folders into the project and run it for the CLI.
